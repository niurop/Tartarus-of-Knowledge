# Tartarus-of-Knowledge

The great Abyss of Knowledge.
A place where You will (at some point) find all the solutions to Your questions.

Here we gather the best explanations of everything that is truly useful.

You will find many ready to go implementations of every known algorithm, so You will no longer need to look for weird libraries on the internet or use costly solutions, but instead just copy/paste our solutions.

No longer will You spend hours upon hours, searching for explanation often not understanding most of it, but here You will find every topic explained in many different ways so You will always find one that works for You.

You will be able to access our open databases for anything You want.

Later we will even create a special search engine to help You look for what You really need.

But right now, this project is just starting off.
We don't have much to offer now.
Heck, we don't even have our own server let alone implementation...

This site is only possible with the help of TiddlyWiki and GitHub.
All the formulas here are perfectly typeset using KaTeX.

But all the explanations, knowledge and data is gathered by people like You, so please support us and give us Your knowledge.
